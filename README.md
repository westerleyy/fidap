This repository of notebooks draws on data queried from the [fidap platform](fidap.com). Most of these datasets are open-data that are accessible to all. What we aim to showcase is how we can pull all of these seemingly disparate sets of data to tell a story, to do some sort of analysis into a known issue.  
  
The notebooks published here in this repo will also be available on the fidap platform.  
  
### Notebooks  
1) `SDOH.ipynb`: This notebook is a Minimum Viable Product of the potential data sources that can be pieced together to calculate and obtain what is termed as the Social Determinants of Health. Health outcomes are a function of prevailing socio-economic and biological conditions. What we aim to capture here are the socio-economic conditions that can potentially play an impact in one's physical wellbeing.  
2) `population_investigation.ipynb`: This notebook gathers together American Community Survey data and zooms in on Manhattan, NY to provide a quick overview of changes in its resident population, income levels, and housing availability.
