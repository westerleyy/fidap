# fidap  
  
This repository of notebooks draws on data queried from the [fidap platform](fidap.com). Most of these datasets are open-data that are accessible to all. What I aim to showcase is how to pull all of these seemingly disparate sets of data to tell a story, to do some sort of analysis into a known issue.  
  
The notebooks published here in this repository used to be hosted on the platform before its pivot into a data infrastructure services provider.
