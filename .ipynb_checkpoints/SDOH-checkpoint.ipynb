    "  \n",
    "This MVP proposed will likely be able to take into account all of the 6 of the 7 factors listed above. Climate Change and Environmental Factors will be amalgamated into one. For the purpose of this MVP, we will primarily gather data on the spatial scale of zip codes, relating to Chicago IL in 2018. [Chicago's zip codes](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/sites/covid/reports/2020-04-24/ChicagoCommunityAreaandZipcodeMap.pdf) also have the distinctive feature of starting with 606. In fact all zip-codes starting with 606 relate to Chicago.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "A lot of the data can be obtained at the zip-code level. Detail and data at the scale of census blocks might not be easily available all the time. It is therefore much preferable to aggregate at the scale of zip codes. Zip codes also have the benefit of being universally understood, as opposed to rather esoteric FIPs codes of Census blocks or Census tracts. However there are multiple problems with using zip codes, but we can address them in future iterations of this product. For the moment, the combined use of ZCTAs from the Census Bureau and Zip Codes are stable enough to provide an indicative MVP.   \n",
