    "On the other hand, Census Tracts, Block Groups, and Blocks are stable statistical units maintained by the US Census Bureau. A glossary of their definitions can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html).   \n",

As ZCTAs pick the most commonly occurring Zip Code, there can be cases that an address in a block is assigned to a Zip Code that is different to its USPS mailing address Zip Code. For the most part however, the ZCTA code is th same as the ZIP code for an area.   \n",
